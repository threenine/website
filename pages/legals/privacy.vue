All of these communications will include a facility to opt-out from receiving any further communication or your social media platform will provide a facility to block further communications from us.</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="prose prose-base leading-7">Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data except where data protection or privacy law requires this. You will have the right to withdraw any such consent at any time by contacting us.</p>
