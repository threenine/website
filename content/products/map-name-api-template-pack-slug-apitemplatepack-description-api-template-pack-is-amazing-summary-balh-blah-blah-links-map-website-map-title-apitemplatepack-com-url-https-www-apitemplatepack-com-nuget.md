Over the past few years there has been an explosion in the usage of API *(Application Programmeable Interface)* which are the interfaces that software apps use

A survey published in early 2022 revealed that 90.5% of developers responding were expecting to use APIs more or the same as in 2021, while only 3.8% think they’ll use fewer. The challenge is, as new APIs and protocols emerge, some aren’t supported by existing API management, development and security platforms.

Software Development teams are struggling to make APIs use-able as a result, leading to duplicated efforts, wasted engineering hours, and missed revenue opportunities.

An Effective, Secure and Scalable API are the lifeblood of innovative companies. Whether it’s internally delivering and consuming APIs to more rapidly and efficiently take new products to market, or monetizing consumer-facing APIs as a revenue stream, APIs are now the core building blocks of successful businesses. More and more more organizations make synchronous and asynchronous API ecosystems a focal point of their business, technical teams now more than ever need to embrace the oncoming API complexity without sacrificing security.

The API Template Pack aims to minimise this effort, by enabling you to quickly generate new service stubs quickly and easily.
