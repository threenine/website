Over the past few years there has been an explosion in the usage of API *(Application Programmeable Interface)* which are the interfaces that software apps use.
              
 A survey published in early 2022 revealed that 90.5% of developers responding were expecting to use APIs more or the 
 same as in 2021, while only 3.8% think they’ll use fewer. The challenge is, as new APIs and protocols emerge, some 
 aren’t supported by existing API management, development and security platforms. 

 Software Development teams are struggling to make APIs use-able as a result, leading to duplicated efforts, 
 wasted engineering hours, and missed revenue opportunities.

An Effective, Secure and Scalable API are the lifeblood of innovative companies. Whether it’s internally delivering and
consuming APIs to more rapidly and efficiently take new products to market, or monetizing consumer-facing APIs as a 
revenue stream, APIs are now the core building blocks of successful businesses. More and more more organizations make 
synchronous and asynchronous API ecosystems a focal point of their business, technical teams now more than ever need

 The API Template Pack aims to minimise this effort, by enabling you to quickly generate new service stubs quickly and easily.
            
The API Template pack provides an opinionated implementation guide to making use of popular leading .net framework based
tools and utilities to assist developers to quickly and efficiently develop secure, stable and resilient REST API’s.

### How the API Template Helps

Creating a resilient, stable and secure REST API’s is a difficult task, and many of the tasks you’ll need to perform 
are quite repetitive and can be error prone if completed incorrectly.

The API Template pack aims to minimise the need to carry out these tasks, enabling you to only focus on the tasks that 
add real business value quickly. The API Template pack helps to steer teams to implementing a number of best
practices and common design patterns including
