We may also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated 
Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly 
or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users 
accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that 
it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance
with this privacy policy. 

We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity,
religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership,

### The legal basis for collection and use of personal data 

We will only collect and use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal 
data in the following circumstances:
 
* Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (or a company you may work for or represent). 
* Where we reasonably believe it is in our legitimate interest for the efficient and proper conduct and development of our business and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. 
* More specifically, where you are either a client or a representative of a client or where we are marketing our services based upon leads generated through use of third party provided information (which may be based upon use of anonymised website visitor identification in combination with publicly available contact information as set out above), we assert it is in our legitimate interest to send you marketing communications via email or to your social media accounts. All of these communications will include a facility to opt-out from receiving any further communication or your social media platform will provide a facility to block further communications from us. 
* Where we need to comply with a legal obligation. 

Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data except where data protection or 
privacy law requires this. You will have the right to withdraw any such consent at any time by contacting us.

### Who your personal information will be shared with  

If registering interest in our services (via an enquiry for example), the personal information you provide will be 
stored in a Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) and made available only to the person(s) who require access 
to it to handle your request.
 
If you are a client or a representative of a client who we will be providing services to, your personal information 
will be stored in our CRM and will be made available only to the person(s) who require access to it to perform the 
contract – this may include our contractors and third parties who may be working on the same project. As applicable, 
these may be located outside the UK in which case the Data Export provisions below shall apply. 

We may disclose your personal data to third-party technical partners that we work with to provide services to you, 
whether through our website or by other means of communication, for the purposes of our contract with those third-party
technical partners and to best ensure we are able to perform our contract with you. Some of our third-party technical 
partners may be located outside the UK and the Data Export provisions below shall apply. Our contracts with specialist 
technical partners contain confidentiality obligations and only permit them to process any personal data as instructed 
by us and in accordance with UK data protection law. 
 
Our third-party technical partners provide services to us which include our CRM platform, email deployment, advertising 
and marketing, security and system performance monitoring, research, data hosting and auditing. Please contact us for 
more details of these if you have further questions about these.

If you are registered to receive emails, your information will additionally be stored securely in an Email Marketing 
Service (EMS), again made available only to the person(s) who require it to respond to this registration. 

If visiting _Threenine Consulting_ at our offices, the personal information provided to our check-in service will be 
recorded securely in that service and delivered only to those people you are there to meet. 

Personal information supplied as part of a contract signature process will be stored in a secure contracts repository 
and/or in an electronic signature management tool, made available only to the relevant personnel. 


When you sign up to be a usability tester, your information will be securely stored and made available only to those 
people who require access to it to facilitate the matching of your details to suitable vacancies and your remuneration 
in the case of being successfully placed within a project. 

If you have submitted an application for a vacancy and/or registered your interest in future vacancies, your 
information will be stored in a separate system, dedicated to the storage of HR information, and will only be made 
available to the person(s) who require access to it to handle this contact. 
 
In all cases, personal information is not otherwise sold or shared with any third parties. 


### Data Export

 Where it is reasonable for the operation and development of our business, your personal data may be transferred and 
 stored outside the UK jurisdictional boundaries. It may also be processed by any of our staff (including contractors), other parties who may 
 be working on a project which your personal data is relevant to or our third-party technical partner, who may be 
 located and operating outside the UK. 

 Where your personal data is to be transferred outside the UK, we will ensure that either: 

1.  there is an “adequacy decision” (which complies with the Data Protection Act 2018) with respect to the data 
2. protection laws of the country to which it is transferred, 
there are appropriate safeguards in place providing enforceable rights and effective legal remedies are available 
3. for individuals, compliant with UK GDPR; or 
where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, 
4. which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the UK / Europe and the US; 
we have entered into a suitable data processing agreement with the third party situated in that country to ensure 
5. the adequate protection of your data. In all cases, transfers outside the UK will be protected by appropriate safeguards. 



### How long will your personal information be kept for

If you have made an enquiry, called in or otherwise engaged with our sales team, registered for an event, or we have 
obtained your personal information from a third-party or publicly available source we will keep your personal 
information (Identity and Contact Data) for up to 36 months from the point at which you last have contact with us. After
this time, this information will be anonymized to be no longer be personal to you and/or it will be deleted. 


If you have provided personal information to us as part of our performance of a contract with you or a client that you 
represent, we will normally keep your personal information (Identity, Contact and Transaction Data) for up to 6 years 
from completion of the relevant project except where the limitation period in the contract is a longer period of time, 
in which case we will keep this personal information for that longer period of time. After this time it will be 
anonymized to be no longer personal to you and/or deleted. 

If you have supplied personal information for marketing purposes (through registering for a newsletter for example) and 
you notify us that you no longer wish to receive these communications, we will only retain the personal information 
required to ensure that this request is complied with (typically email address).

If you have supplied your information while checking in at our offices this (and the associated information about when 
you were there) will be kept for a period of one month before being deleted.

Personal information supplied as part of a contract signature process will kept in line with the contract retention 
period, typically seven years from end of service provision.

If you have supplied personal information in signing up to be a usability tester it will be kept only for as long as is
necessary to facilitate the project in question, unless you have asked to be contacted in future about additional 
testing opportunities. In the case of having registered for future contact, your details will be retained until such
point as you notify us that you no longer wish to be registered for this service. 

If you have supplied personal information in applying for a vacancy it will be kept for 6 months after the end of the 
recruitment process for that role unless you have asked to be contacted in future about other such vacancies. In the

### Your right to erasure of your personal information

In certain circumstances you have the right to have personal data we hold about you erased. This will be done without 
undue delay. These circumstances include the following: it is no longer necessary for us to hold personal data in 
relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw your consent to any 
processing that requires consent; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; or the personal data has been 
unlawfully processed. 

However, there are certain general exclusions of the right to erasure, including where processing is necessary: for 
exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation; 
or for establishing, exercising or defending legal claims.

### Your right to restrict processing of your personal information

In certain circumstances you have the right for the processing of your personal data to be restricted. This is the 
case where: you do not think that the personal data we hold about you is accurate; your data is being processed 
unlawfully, but you do not want your data to be erased; it is no longer necessary for us to hold your personal data for
the purposes of our processing, but you still require that personal data in relation to a legal claim; or you have 
objected to processing, and are waiting for that objection to be verified.

Where processing has been restricted for one of these reasons, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we
will only process it for other reasons: with your consent; in relation to a legal claim; for the protection of the 
rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest. 


### Your right to object to processing of your personal information
 
You may object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless our legal 
basis for the processing is that it is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or 
in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third 
party. 

If you make an objection, we will stop processing your personal information unless we are able to: demonstrate 
compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, and that these legitimate grounds override your interests, rights and 
freedoms; or the processing is in relation to a legal claim. 


### Your right to make a complaint

If you think that our processing of your personal data infringes data protection laws, you have the right to lodge a 
complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office the UK regulator for data protection issues [www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk "Information Commissioners Office"). 

We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance at privacy@threenine.co.uk , and we assure you that your concerns will be promptly and properly investigated.
