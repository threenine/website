### Personal data & Information we collect

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together in broad classifications as follows:

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

* **Identity Data** includes first name, maiden name, last name, social media account usernames or similar identifier, date of birth and gender. 
* **Contact Data** includes billing address, delivery address, email address, social media account details and telephone numbers.
* **Experience and Education Data** includes details of salary expectations, educational and professional qualifications, current and previous employment and work experience (as typically provided in a curriculum vitae).

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
We may also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data).
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

### How we collect personal information

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**Direct interactions.** You may give us your Identity and Contact Data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide when you:

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

* enquire about our products or services;
* interact with us as a client or on behalf of a client (when we will also collect Transaction Data);

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**Automated technologies or interactions.** As you interact with our website, we will automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies and other similar technologies. Please see our cookie policy below for further details.
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**Third parties or publicly available sources.** We may receive personal data about you from various third parties (including public sources), which we may combine with or add to personal information you have directly provided to us, as set out below:

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

* Identity and Contact Data from publicly available sources such as Linked In, Companies House.

* Technical Data from analytics providers such as Google Analytics, who may be based outside the UK;

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

### The legal basis for collection and use of personal data 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

We will only collect and use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

* Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (or a company you may work for or represent). 
* Where we reasonably believe it is in our legitimate interest for the efficient and proper conduct and development of our business and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. 
* More specifically, where you are either a client or a representative of a client or where we are marketing our services based upon leads generated through use of third party provided information (which may be based upon use of anonymised website visitor identification in combination with publicly available contact information as set out above), we assert it is in our legitimate interest to send you marketing communications via email or to your social media accounts. All of these communications will include a facility to opt-out from receiving any further communication or your social media platform will provide a facility to block further communications from us. 
* Where we need to comply with a legal obligation. 

Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data except where data protection or privacy law requires this. You will have the right to withdraw any such consent at any time by contacting us.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

### Who your personal information will be shared with  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
If registering interest in our services (via an enquiry for example), the personal information you provide will be stored in a Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) and made available only to the person(s) who require access to it to handle your request.
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
If you are a client or a representative of a client who we will be providing services to, your personal information will be stored in our CRM and will be made available only to the person(s) who require access to it to perform the contract – this may include our contractors and third parties who may be working on the same project. As applicable, these may be located outside the UK in which case the Data Export provisions below shall apply. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
We may disclose your personal data to third-party technical partners that we work with to provide services to you, whether through our website or by other means of communication, for the purposes of our contract with those third-party technical partners and to best ensure we are able to perform our contract with you. Some of our third-party technical partners may be located outside the UK and the Data Export provisions below shall apply. Our contracts with specialist technical partners contain confidentiality obligations and only permit them to process any personal data as instructed by us and in accordance with UK data protection law. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
Our third-party technical partners provide services to us which include our CRM platform, email deployment, advertising and marketing, security and system performance monitoring, research, data hosting and auditing. Please contact us for more details of these if you have further questions about these. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
If you are registered to receive emails, your information will additionally be stored securely in an Email Marketing Service (EMS), again made available only to the person(s) who require it to respond to this registration. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
If visiting Threenine Consulting at our offices, the personal information provided to our check-in service will be recorded securely in that service and delivered only to those people you are there to meet. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
Personal information supplied as part of a contract signature process will be stored in a secure contracts repository and/or in an electronic signature management tool, made available only to the relevant personnel. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

When you sign up to be a usability tester, your information will be securely stored and made available only to those people who require access to it to facilitate the matching of your details to suitable vacancies and your remuneration in the case of being successfully placed within a project. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
If you have submitted an application for a vacancy and/or registered your interest in future vacancies, your information will be stored in a separate system, dedicated to the storage of HR information, and will only be made available to the person(s) who require access to it to handle this contact. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
In all cases, personal information is not otherwise sold or shared with any third parties. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

### Data Export

 Where it is reasonable for the operation and development of our business, your personal data may be transferred and stored outside of the UK. It may also be processed by any of our staff (including contractors), other parties who may be working on a project which your personal data is relevant to or our third-party technical partner, who may be located and operating outside of the UK. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Where your personal data is to be transferred outside of the UK, we will ensure that either: 

1.  there is an “adequacy decision” (which complies with the Data Protection Act 2018) with respect to the data protection laws of the country to which it is transferred, 
2.  there are appropriate safeguards in place providing enforceable rights and effective legal remedies are available for individuals, compliant with UK GDPR; or 
3.  where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the UK / Europe and the US; 
4.  we have entered into a suitable data processing agreement with the third party situated in that country to ensure the adequate protection of your data. In all cases, transfers outside of the UK will be protected by appropriate safeguards.
